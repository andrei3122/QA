Description:
It has been discovered that, when hovering the mouse over the items at the top of the main page, each item goes into drop-down mode showing multiple options, while pricing is only clickable. This inconsistency may confuse users expecting uniform behavior.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a browser (Google Chrome)
2. Go to https://www.orangehrm.com/
3. Hover the mouse over the items at the top of the page
4. Observe that Pricing cannot be hovered

Expected results:
Hovering the mouse over Pricing will show a dropdown menu with prices

Actual results:
The Pricing link is the only clickable option.
