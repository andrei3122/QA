Description:
It has been observed that, when the user hover their mouse over the items from the drop-down menu, the new window of options may disappear before the user can click one of the new links.

Steps to reproduce:
- Open a browser (Google Chrome)
- Go to https://www.orangehrm.com/
- Hover over one of the items at the top (e.g. "Why OrangeHRM")
- Hover over one of the new items (e.g. "Stakeholder Solutions")
- Move the mouse upwards or downwards until the new menu disappears.

Expected Results:
Hovering the mouse over the new items will allow the user to make the next item selection.

Actual Results:
Moving the muse in an "incorrect" manner will result in the new menu items to disappear.
