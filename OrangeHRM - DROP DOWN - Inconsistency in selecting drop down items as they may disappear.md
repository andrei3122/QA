Description:
It has been observed that, when the user hover their mouse over the items from the drop-down menu, the new window of options may disappear before the user can click one of the new links.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a browser (Google Chrome)
2. Go to https://www.orangehrm.com/
3. Hover over one of the items at the top (e.g. "Why OrangeHRM")
4. Hover over one of the new items (e.g. "Stakeholder Solutions")
5. Move the mouse upwards or downwards until the new menu disappears.

Expected Results:
Hovering the mouse over the new items will allow the user to make the next item selection.

Actual Results:
Moving the muse in an "incorrect" manner will result in the new menu items to disappear.
